Timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals

## User Story
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score

## Description
This is a quiz to judge how much you know about JavaScript! I built this project to test the users' knowledge about JS. I learned more about functions and for loops, how to store and access data in local storage, and how to toggle between screens using JavaScript. I also learned how to create elements and classes using only JavaScript.
